		<h2>How to Play</h2>
		<p>The players draw and play cards until the imploding puppy card is drawn.</p>
		<p>When the Imploding puppy card is drawn, one of two things happen: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the player has a kickball card they can kick the puppy back into the deck.</li>
			<li>If not, then the puppy implodes and they die.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you have a skip card you can skip drawing a card this turn. </p>
