# implodingPuppies
Imploding puppies is an attempt to create a game like exploding kittens online

----
## Task
The task given was to use the knowledge that we gained in our training with Sparta Global, to create an online game. 

The choice of game was personal, Imploding puppies was born thanks to the creator having played and enjoyed the card game Exploding Kittens. 


### Functionality 
This game was created using HTML5, CSS, Javascript and Jquery. 
It can be run on any machine capable of displaying a webpage.

## Setup 
### Setup
To set this masterful creation up on a machine of your choice you can create a git clone or download a zip file of the repository. Once you have the files you can navigate to the page in your browser using the Index.html file that is in the imploding puppies folder.

### Planning
The very first step in this process was to take my idea of a game and create a wireframe of what i expected to need to do as well as creating some milestones to give me an impression of the things that needed to be done.

## Creation
### Layout 
This first task that was done was deciding on the layout of the page. This was done in HTML and CSS, creating the Header and Gameboard were quickly done the gamebord has bothe the player and computer hands inside it. The cards are created dynamically as they are drawn in javascript.

The message and score boards are to the left of the screen on the basis that in western culture we tend to read from the left to the right. The deck and discard pile are to the right as the gameboard is in the middle but they need to be able to be used from whereever. 

The very first thing I did was to create the base of the game this included, the header, and the linking and testing of the javascript and CSS files. 

The second part was starting to create the layout of the game which included:

* The gameboard, 
* Each of the players hands 
* The areas for the discard and deck to sit. 

The next thing that happend was creating the CSS to complete the layout. The instructions were also created and the cards and classes were created to start testing the layout.

The deck was created, in javascript, as an array, and a function was created in order to fill that array with the values. This was tested by logging the array to the console.

The next and final step in the preperations was to create the players hands and show them on screen. 
This was done using the following code. 

``` 
function dealCard(destination, origin) {		
 	var randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * deck.length);
 	var card = origin.splice(randomNumber, 1)[0];
 	addTo(destination, 1, card)
 
 	return card;
 	}
 	function dealHands(deck, playerHand, comHand){
 		for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
 			dealCard(playerHand, deck);
 			dealCard(comHand, deck);
 		}
 	}
 	function dispPlayHand(dest, hand){
 		$(dest).each( function(index){
 			var num = hand[index];
 			$(this).addClass(hand[index]).html(hand[index]);
 		});	
 	}
 	```

The second function is used to deal 5 cards to the player this is done by calling the dealCard function. 
The dealCard creates a randon number that is used to pull a variable  from the deck.

The dispPlayHand simply takes each of the arrays for each of teh players and sends those values to each of the cards in the HTML. 

This was the base of the game from hereon, the talk shall mostly be on the implementation of the gameplay.

### Creation of the Gameplay
From this point on the gameplay was implemented, at the end of the players turn they have to draw a card so the following code was created so that when they clicked on the deck there would be a process that took place. 

``` function deckClick(turn){
	$('#deck').click(function(argument) {
		if (turn == 'player'){
			dealCard(playerHand, deck)
			addCardToHand('#playHand', playerHand)
			turn = 'com'
		}else{
			dealCard(comHand, deck)
			addCardToHand('#comHand', comHand)
			turn = 'player'
		}
	})
}```

This checked to see whose turn it was and then distributed a card to that player using the functions demonstrated above.

```
function addCardToHand(dest, hand) {
		$(dest).append($('<div></div>').addClass('card '+ hand[hand.length - 1]).html(hand[hand.length -1]))
	}
```
addCardToHand was a simple creation function that created a new card onscreen using the values it is given.

This iteration was quickly improved by the addition of a way for cards to be moved to the discard pile. A number of CSS improvements were made as well. After prodigious testing it was determined that the next phase could be implemented.
